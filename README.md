# Netkov_gh

Active and messy. Currently training.. Cleaning and More to come here soon.

train.py contains codes to use triplet learning.    
Netkov.py contains codes to use different resnet, inception architectures with or without parallel shallow networks (as in below papers, not suitable for Transfer Learning).  
ProxyUtils.py is for implementing proxy loss, proxy learning testing and data loading. Modify it according to your needs.  
ProxyTrain.py is for using proxy learning proposed in the first paper below.
